**Started the year with 50 miles!**

===

Since I had the day off (yea holidays) I'd decided I try to start the year off with a nice long bike ride. Now I'm not sure what you think a long bike ride is, but I consider it to be around 50 miles or longer.

Well today I rode 50 miles.

One my sister's generally has folks over on New Year's Day and she lives almost exactly 25 miles from me so it was a really a no-brainer. I'd said I'd drop by if the weather were good and it was darn nearly a cloudless day when I set off.

I'd chosen my Quickbeam for the ride, mostly because my Hunqapillar has a flat, my Bike Friday is in its suitcase, and my Fujiyama (never heard of it, check my other blog, [statrix.com](http://statrix.com)) isn't quite the bike I'd chose for 50 miles...though I've ridden it some good distances.

In truth the QB is the perfect bicycle for this ride as there are few hills and in its current state it is light and lively.

After morning coffee I headed out, cycling through Honolulu proper to begin, and then out towards Aiea and points west.

The [Pearl Harbor Bike Path](http://www.traillink.com/trail/pearl-harbor-bike-path.aspx), often maligned, is actually a pretty good ride. It runs from our Stadium to the town of Waipahu. Yes it's industrial in parts, yes there are homeless encampments, and yes, in parts it's kind of a mess, but darn it, it does its job - I can get to my sister's place on it and in parts it is really lovely. You can't blame the homeless problem in Hawaii on the bike path. But I digress.

After the bike path I cycled down Fort Weaver Rd until it was time to turn to Kapolei and head to sis. It was such a nice day I decided I'd follow some of our old railroad tracks and get in a just a bit of rain-to-trail riding in. It's good I decided on just a bit because frankly, that's all of we've got. A mile...maybe.

It was fun and I love the way the QB handles off the pavement. I was sorted of reminded of bits of my travels around Atlanta earlier this...oops...last year.

Indeed I liked it so much I repeated it on the way back effectively doubling my off-road riding for the year!

I'd been heading into the wind on the way out though it wasn't much of a wind. I'd had hopes tha the direction would stay constant and I'd benefit on the way home and, surprisingly given our fickle island weather, it did and I did. The sky had clouded up and threatened showers from time to time but I made it home safe and dry having gotten in my first ride of the year. It was a good one!

Aloha and let's see what the rest of weekend has to offer!
