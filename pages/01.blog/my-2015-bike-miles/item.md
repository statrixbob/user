**I rode some miles this year!**

===

It turns out I rode a lot of miles this year; at least a lot for me. You, of course, may have ridden more. Less is good too though - as long as you get on your bike!

Chances are my 2016 mileage will be in the same general ballpark. While I did a number of longer rides, most of this mileage was accumulated around town riding as a commuter. My average per day is just under 15 miles a day for the year, and just over 16 miles a day for the days I actually rode and remembered to track my mileage. I'm sure I missed tracking more than a few miles, but probably not enough to goose up those averages by too much.

I'm hoping to start the new year out right with a longish ride tomorrow, but we'll have to see what the weather holds!

Keep the rubber side down!
