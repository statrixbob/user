![John P. Hammond](http://www.buffalo-music.com/uploads/7/5/6/2/75629929/7601496_orig.jpg)

The past week has been a big bluesfest of sorts in the person of John P. Hammond. For those who don't know, he's one of the premier blues artists of our time. You can check him out on the [John P. Hammond Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_P._Hammond) or better yet, [his own website](http://www.johnhammond.com).

So why a fest?

When I heard that Mr. Hammond was coming to Honolulu I had to check out at least one show. You see I'd met Mr. Hammond way, way back. As a young man I was a server at Milwaukee's Blue River Cafe and he played that, more than once I think, but I definitely remember the once I saw him. Keeping in mind this was 35 years ago, I can still remember lots of shows I saw there and his was one that stuck out. 

Further, and though we never met there, we both went to Antioch College, he in 1961 I think and myself in 1976 and 1977. We both dropped out; he for a music career, and me, well let's just say I didn't set the world on fire. 

I should note that I'm also a guitar player, not, of course, on a par with Mr. Hammond, but I do amuse myself and sometimes my family, and I do love the blues. 

Last Wednesday I a friend and I showed up at [HPR's Atherton Theatre](http://hawaiipublicradio.org/post/atherton-2016-summer-season) for  the first of his Hawaii concerts. The Atherton is an intimate and acoustically fabulous venue for a concert and no one in attendance was disappointed. Wow. My buddy and I were just off to the side in a front row with plenty of legroom and an unimpeded view. Wow. That's about all I can say. I've been to other great concerts there and I love this place.

Friday found me in Honoka'a on Hawaii Island at the People's Theatre for the second of the shows I was able to see. The space is very different from the Atherton, but it's a great spot and again Mr. Hammond provided a wonderful show. 

And finally, last night, Tuesday June 14, 2016, I decided to catch the last of his Hawaii shows at Hawaiian Brian's. Again Mr. Hammond provided a super show, may be the best of those I saw this past week. 

If you've never heard him you owe yourself a treat. There's lots of video out there and, given his prolific output, you can certainly purchase his music on CD or electronic format. I bought a signed copy of Timeless, his 2014 live CD. To be honest I don't actually have a CD player, but it's hard to sign an MP3. 

I was able to chat for a moment or two with him at each of the concerts and the only thing that exceeds his musical talent is his graciousness with fans. He's a mensch. 

Which brings me to today - just when I thought my John P. Hammond Hawaii experience was over, at least for the time being. On a break from work I headed over to my local Starbucks and guess who was there getting coffee for his wife Marla? Yep. Still gracious and happy to chat for a minute or two. Wow. I tried not to make too big a fool of myself. Yes I got a picture, not I didn't try to find out where he's staying or if he has time for <insert whatever>. I did have to get back to work after all. :-)

Aloha!
