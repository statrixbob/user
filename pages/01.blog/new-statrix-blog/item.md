**I'm trying something new, or at least new for me.**

===

My usual blog, [statrix.com](http://statrix.com), has been dormant for a bit. Not really a good thing, but it's okay. I've only got about three people who look at it and at least one of them is me. 

Recently I was asked to look into what it would take to get a local annual event online. I'm the webmaster for a couple of non-profit entities, though honestly I'm trying to give them up, and thought I'd give my two cents as long as I didn't have to get too involved.

That, of course, led to this. 

I've been using Wordpress for years and think it's a great tool. That's the upside. The downside is that I've been using Wordpress for years. Nothing wrong with it,. but I've been feeling stale.

I also noticed I had a bunch of domains floating around that aren't really being used, including:

* [statrix.com](http://statrix.com)
* [statrix.org](https://statrix.org)
* [statrix.info](https://statrix.info)
* [statrix.net](http://statrix.net)

Now I do use the .com, and, as you can see, I'm using .org (and you may be seeing this as .info as well). The .net is being used a Google Apps thing and I've not figured where to go with that. 

Now with domains alone I realized I was spread over a few registrars and a variety of prices. I'd recently discovered that Google was offering a new service, [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com) and doing it relatively cheaply. As $12 a year including privacy it was too good to turn down. 

I also wanted to play a bit, but not with Wordpress. That's when I discovered [Grav](https://getgrav.org). It's a flat file CMS instead of the more usual SQL powered CMS. That appealed to me 'just because.' 

I also found I could run this off of the virtual server service DigitalOcean at very low price. I'm hoping it works out to about $5 a month. I'm currently paying about $200 a year for a 'normal' host solution (and without too much complaint), but cutting that in half or better would be great.

So…here we are.

My first post (Pani Ka Puka)[https://statrix.org/pani-ka-puka] was really just a test to learn a bit about all of this, including images. This post is just a notice saying…well, among other things, *I like it*.

More later!
