**Across the midwest by bicycle!**

On Saturday night the RAGBRAI route planners announced the 2016 RAGBRAI XLIV overnight towns. It's, as many suspected, a southern route. Normally this would mean a lot of hills, but apparently this isn't going to be the case. Yes there'll be hills, but the ride is about average (for RAGBRAIS) as far as climbing goes. That still means you'll hear a lot of lying. To wit, "only one more hill before..."

Then there's the portion of my summer that has nothing to do with RAGBRAI other than it's about bicycles, riding across country, and starting from where RAGBRAI leaves off. Actually that's quite a bit about RAGBRAI, isn't it?
