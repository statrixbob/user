**Vog...your kidding me!**

===

If you live in Hawaii (or anyplace near a volcano) you've probably encountered vog. What is you ask? Let's consult [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vog):

> Vog is a form of air pollution that results when sulfur dioxide and other gases and particles emitted by an erupting volcano react with oxygen and moisture in the presence of sunlight. The word is a portmanteau of the words "volcanic", "smog", and "fog".

Here's an overview as it were....

You can read about that particular image on NASA's wonderful [Earth Observatory](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=8800&src=ve) blog.

What's the point?

Glad you asked. A lot of folks have health issued related to vog.  It can make it really hard to breath for some folks and with other it can create a variety of symptom. I've been lucky and relatively symptom free for most of my life. This week I'm not quite so sure.

We had a fair bit of vog this week and I really though I was coming down with a cold or the flu some of the time. Not all the time mind you, just enough to think it was real.

Was it vog or a bug?

I'll be honest, I don't know. A bit of chest congestion, a low grade headache, and general torpor; could be a cold, right? Right. It's also the same symptoms I know some folks get this vog.

Sigh.

In any case it seems to be over today, which is nice, as it's the first day of a long weekend.

And hopefully, if the weather holds I'll be having a nice long ride on Monday...Honolulu to Haleiwa anyone? Or maybe even the reverse. I've thought about going both ways, but am I really up for 150+ miles?

Not if there's vog, that's for sure.

And if you want to learn more about vog, check out this great site from the [Unversity of Hawaii](http://weather.hawaii.edu/vmap/hysplit/index.cgi?banner=uhmet&domain=haw&variable=so4&orient=horiz&anim=java).

Aloha!
