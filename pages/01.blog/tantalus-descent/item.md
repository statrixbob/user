**360 Video! Tantalus Descent**

===

I think you'll need to view this video in Chrome...

It's a 360 degree video of my descent from Tantalus today. I finally got around to climbing it, the first time ever - don't know why I waited so long. It wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it might be. I didn't even have to, as Erich says, "Go to my special place."

Enjoy!
