**It's my birthday...again!**

===
Another year! And, while I guess I'm not overjoyed at being older at this stage of my life, the alternative is far, far less appealing.

And who knew? Even Google is celebrating my birthday...as I discovered with my first Google search of the day.

I've received a few gifts, a couple of phone calls, an offer for dinner, and...well...my own congratulations.

What do I mean? Let's see...

- I'm more or less sane.
- I've gotten my weight under control (I even had a weigh-in this morning at work to see what happened over the holidays - for the chance to win $1000).
- I ride my bike a lot and plan on riding a lot more.


There's a lot more I'm grateful for today and everyday, birthday or not, but I'll keep it simple today. 

And tomorrow...hopefully!
