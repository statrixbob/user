**2016 is just around the corner!**

===

It's just about 2016. The fireworks outside are picking up in intensity and I'm just about ready for bed. Indeed I'm more or less there already, watching a movie and saying goodbye to 2015.

It's been a good year. I have much to be grateful for this year including, but not limited to:

* I lost a lot of weight - yesiree!
* I kept it off
* I got to bike a lot, including the GAP/C&O Canal route
* My hip healed up just fine and has been giving me no trouble
* I have a family who loves me, even if I joke that they put up with me
* I've got friends, good ones
* I didn't do anything incredibly stupid this year (stupid yes, incredibly, not so much)

All in all, it's been a good. Very good.

And 2016, it promises to be even better!
