**I love it when a plan comes together**

No, this isn't about the A-Team. Though I have to thank all the folks who are helping me out with my summer plans. They're my A-Team.

I've been hella busy recently but still found some time to book flights, get hotels, and let that A-Team know i'm a comin'.

So far I've booked a flight to Denver. This was a deal, though not the best I'm getting this summer. I had enough miles to book a one-way flight to Denver and then I spent a few bucks upgrading it to Economy Plus. I ended up paying about $200 for the whole thing which isn't bad.

Denver is my first stop and I'll be visiting one a good friend who moved there from Honolulu last year, a friend from my high school days, and my biking buddy Erich. I'll be arriving on a Saturday and if I'm not mistaken we'll be heading to Iowa the following Friday. I've never been to Denver that I recall so I'm looking forward to this part of the trip a lot. Okay, I'm looking forward to all parts of the trip.

Next up is Iowa and [RAGBRAI](http://ragbrai.com). I've written about this a few times, most recently [back in January[(https://statrix.org/blog/ragbrai-route)]. We'll have a day to explore the expo and a bit of Iowa then we're off for the first day of the ride. Erich is doing the first day, but then will be heading back to Colorado. He's the first star of my A-Team but there'll be more.

RAGBRAI ends in Muscatine this year and I plan on spending a day there, arriving Saturday and leaving Monday. I managed to get a hotel room by booking immediately after the route announcement.

Yes!

Then I'm off for Wisconsin, by bike of course. I don't have a route picked yet so the map below is wrong. Mostly, sort of. Yes, it's one possible route computed by Google Maps, but I haven't actually figured out much. Nor is the portion of the map that shows the RAGBRAI route correct. Yes those are the towns we'll be staying in overnight, but I've no idea of the pass-through towns - that information has not been decided/released yet.

Still this map does give me an idea of scope of my ride:

Well...to be honest, I'm not any less busy today so I'm off. I can't believe it's already February. July'll be here before I know it...wow.
