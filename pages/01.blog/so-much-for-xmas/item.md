*Another Christmas, thank goodness for family!*

===

Another Christmas. And yes, it was a good one. My dad was in town and that's a bonus.

He looked great and was having a wonderful time. We all did.

My family generally gets together for a big, but easy to make, Christmas meal on Christmas Day.  This year there was a lot of barbecued meat, salad, and pupus. 

I'd made some kalua pig in my pressure cooker that morning, so that's what I contributed to the mix. One of my grand-nieces liked it so I was happy. 

I'm not a big Xmas guy, I don't generally exchange gifts and frankly I'm more comfortable with Thanksgiving for a variety of reasons, but this was a very, very nice Christmas. 

Not really much else to say about it, except, Love you dad!

Merry Christmas
