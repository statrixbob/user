**Wildwood Flower, learning to flatpick**

===

I've owned one guitar or another for most of my life. I've actually been playing guitar for a lot less time. When I was 10 or 11 I studied classical guitar as I recall, then a bit of 'folk.' I wa much better at classical - didn't care of the folk instuctor I guess. I managed never to learn much music theory.

Life intervened and I more or less gave up playing for a long time, though I would pick up the darn thing and strum a chord or two from time to time.

Well I'm older now - a lot older. Somehow I though it might be fun to give it another try and to my surprise, it's a lot easier than I recall. I'm still not good, but hey I enjoy it.

Here's what I've been working on lately:
